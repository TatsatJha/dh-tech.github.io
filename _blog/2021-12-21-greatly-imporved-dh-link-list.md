  tips for resources and tools as a pull request! "

[Moritz MÃ¤hr](https://github.com/maehr) kindly offered to merge his external Digital History link list with our admittedly outdated awesome-dhtools list. He also included Github actions to make the list a member of the [awesome lists ecosystem](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). The much improved list can now be accessed at [dh-tech.github.io/awesome-dhtools/](https://dh-tech.github.io/awesome-dhtools/)

You can help us grow this useful resource by adding your own links to resources and tools via pull requests [here](https://github.com/dh-tech/awesome-dhtools). It is of course also possible to advertise your own DH-related tools, corpora, or websites via the awesome list. 

We are looking forward to your input!
