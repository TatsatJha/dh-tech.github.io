excerpt: "The first DHtech Meetup as a SIG took place on 29th of September.  The
  initial steering committee was introduced and showed some ongoing projects of
  the SIG. The attendees discussed the specific focus of DH software development
  in context to the wider RSE movement. "

Apart from the presented projects of the mentor-ship program, which will offer a long term, low frequency partnership between members working on various DH topics, and the community code review initiative, which also aims to improve the code quality of DH projects, attendees talked about their ongoing work in DH. A common theme that quickly emerged was the need for sustainability measures and of course the ever returning topic of finding qualified software developers on the one hand and training students in DH on the other hand.

On the more policy oriented side, the need for clarifying the goals of the SIG and its relation to other software-focused initiatives, like the RSE movement or the Software Sustainability Initiative were addressed. Several points were made, which in the opinion of the attendees are unique topics of the DHtech SIG community, e.g. the strong focus on data source criticism due to data heterogeneity and therefore workflows of data curation, as well as the ethical implications of working with specific sources, which also implies the close interaction of DH RSEs with non-coding experts in their code development.

The next meetup will take place in mid November and revolve around projects, both in their initial phase as well as matured, that have to work with fuzzy or unclear dates.
