The development of software specifically designed for the Digital Humanities has been become more and more important as Digital Humanities projects become increasingly computationally sophisticated. At the Digital Humanities Conference 2017 in Montr√©al, a group of software developers, scholars with programming expertise, and project managers got together to develop an infrastructure for collaboration and cooperation in regards to tool development. The result was the establishment of DHTech.

The goal of DHTech is to support the development and reuse of software in the Digital Humanities by providing a community to exchange knowledge, share expertise, and foster collaboration among Digital Humanities software projects. Anyone involved in Digital Humanities tools development is welcome to join.

If you would like to become part of DHTech, you can join our Slack channel and our <a href="http://github.com/dh-tech">GitHub organization</a> by filling out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeAe1MlCPOCVlY7YsJUcLv1_tDBtEOBNJ2vhCe6aWcvAl-ehQ/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a>.
