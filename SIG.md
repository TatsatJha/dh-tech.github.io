## Governance

The DHTech ADHO Special Interest Group (SIG), hereafter DHTech, will be led by a steering commitee. The steering committee will be made up of 5 to 7 members, and shall always be an odd number to avoid any danger of tied votes.

The initial steering committee members were chosen as interim leadership as the DHTech organization structure becomes more formalized as an ADHO SIG. After one year, half of the initial steering committee will rotate off and be replaced by new members selected via self-nomination and member vote. Members interested in serving on the steering committee will have the opportunity to nominate themselves with a short paragraph communicating their interest. Nominee statements will be shared with DHTech members for review and voting. All members of DH Tech will be allowed to vote on nominees, and the nominees with the most votes will be elected.

After the first year, steering committee members will serve a term of two years to provide continuity as new committee members rotate on and off each year.  Steering committee members who are unable to complete their term of service may step down early. Their spot on the committee will be filled by a member of DH Tech; the top unelected nomineee from the most recent election will be asked to serve first.

All members of DHTech are members of the DHTech ADHO Special Interest Group, whether or not they are members of ADHO or an ADHO Constituent Organization.
