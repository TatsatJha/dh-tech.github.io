## Code Review Working Group

The Code Review Working Group works on developing a community code review system for the digital humanities. The group meets on the third Wednesday of every month 11am-12pm ET. Please join the `#code-review-wg` channel on Slack or get in touch with Julia Damerow (jdamerow@asu.edu) if you are interested in joining.

Guides for submitting code for review or volunteering to become a reviewer are avialable on the [DH Community Code review](https://dhcodereview.github.io/), along with related information and links to recent reviews.
