We are honored to announce that we have been awarded a $30,000 Chair’s Award from the National Endowment for the Humanities. This grant will create a pilot for a Digital Humanities Research Software Consulting Unit (DHReSCU). DhReSCU’s mission will be to aid early-stage digital humanities research software projects in developing a technical implementation plan.

The grant provided by NEH will help the DHReSCU pilot program determine the extent and needs for a consulting unit in DH research software. The resulting feedback and project outcomes of DHReSCU will shape its future operations.
