Members of the DHtech group are planning to propose a Special Interest Group (SIG) to the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) that focuses on the technical side of DH such as tool development and maintenance.


If you are interested in being involved in the proposal writing, want to follow the discussion or are simply interested in the general topic of DH technology,
you are most welcome to [join](https://dh-tech.github.io/join/) our Slack and GitHub organization.

The discussion is taking place in the channel #sig-planning.
