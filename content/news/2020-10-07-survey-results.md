The survey was comprised of 23 questions. 66 people responded to the survey. If you have not yet responded but would like to, the survey will remain open and is available here: [https://forms.gle/qya3qE9mk24HvUXf8](https://forms.gle/qya3qE9mk24HvUXf8). We will post updates to the current results after we have received a significant number of additional responses.

Notes about the survey:

- Any multi-choice question that had an "Other" option, allowed to enter additional values not included in the provided options.
- This post shows the results for all questions except questions that need more work on anonymizing the responses, and questions that asked for free text responses, which will need more work to anonymize and categorize.
- In most cases, bar charts indicate that multiple responses where possible; pie charts indicate that the respondent could only select one answer.
