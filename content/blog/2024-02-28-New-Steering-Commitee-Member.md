Hello! My name is <a href="https://hernandezj1.github.io/">Jose Hernandez</a> and I am very excited to be joining your DHTech Steering committee. I decided to join because I am very passionate about the use of emerging technologies in DH (supercomputing, quantum, etc.) and the creation of education materials at all preparation levels of our fields! I currently focus on these in my own work as a technology specialist at Florida State University’s Research Computing Center. I hope to be able to serve our community by continuing the good work and ongoing efforts of my colleagues. My main goal is to continue fostering a space where everybody can approach anybody and ask for help at any time. Community has always been an integral part of my growth as a person and academic, therefore I am looking forward to creating and contributing to such a space in my time on the committee.

Outside of DH I love track and field and I have been a coach for over 6 years. I am also originally from Puerto Rico and like breaking my head learning new programming languages or human ones ( current challenges: FORTRAN and German)

Please feel free to reach out to me on Slack if you have anything to talk about concerning any DHTech work, particularly the Education & Training Working group, or if you just want to discuss any new DH methods ( I’m specially fond of historical network projects!).
