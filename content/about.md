The goal of DHTech is to support the development and reuse of software in the Digital Humanities
by providing a community to exchange knowledge, share expertise, and foster collaboration among Digital Humanities software projects. Anyone involved in Digital Humanities tools and services development and maintenance is welcome to join.

The development of software specifically designed for the Digital Humanities has become more and more important as Digital Humanities projects become increasingly computationally sophisticated.
At the Digital Humanities Conference 2017 in Montreal, a group of software developers, scholars with programming expertise, and project managers got together to develop an infrastructure for collaboration and cooperation in regards to tool development.
The result was the establishment of DHTech.

The original DHTech logo was designed by Johannes Biermann and Alexander Steckel. That logo was adapted and updated by Rebecca Sutton Koeser in 2023 (read [about the logo redesign](/blog/2023-10-27-new-logo/)).
