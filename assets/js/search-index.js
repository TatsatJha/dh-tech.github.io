lunr_index.add({ url: '/workshops/2020-02-27-deploy-packaging/', title: "Deployment, Release, and Packaging Workflows", body: "## Webinar Summary\n\nOn February 27, 2020, a total of 11 DHTech members met for a webinar on the topic of deployment, release, and packaging workflows. Several people described the workflows and tools they employ at their organizations followed by a lively (and interesting) discussion of questions and answers.\n\n### CESSDA ERIC\n\nFirst, John (supported by Matthew, Joshua, and Carsten) from CESSDA ERIC described their infrastructure setup. Their applications run on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)/[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) cluster on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine). Their code is hosted on Bitbucket and they have set up a [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) pipeline that deploys to their development, staging, and production environments. They pointed out that one of their lessons learnt has been to build one container for all environments, rather than a separate built for each environment to avoid any differences or deviations between the multiple environments and thus surprises in production that could not be reproduced in test environments.\n\nSome of the other technologies they use are [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) to combine test results, [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to manage their multiple Kubernetes resources, [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/) for monitoring and log management, [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) for interface translations, [Nexus repository](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss) for artifact hosting and [HAProxy]().\n\nMoreover, to ensure sustainability and maintainability, CESSDA ERIC requires the guidelines published [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2614050) to be followed by any component to be deployed on their infrastructure. One of their requirements is that any component needs to be provided as a Docker container, which can then be added to their clusters.\n\n### Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University\n\nNext, Rebecca and Nick from the [Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University](https://cdh.princeton.edu/) talked about their deployment/publishing workflow of Python/Django apps and Python packages. Their [code is hosted on GibHub](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH) and unit tests are executed using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). They use [Pa11y CI](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci) to check for accessibility issues as they develop. Their applications are manually deployed using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), which they have integrated with their Slack workspace to alert them of running deployments. They also have a [few Python packages that are published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/cdhdevteam/).\n\nTo ensure code quality, they use [CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/), which even provides them with a measurement of technical debt! They have local development environments plus staging and production environments.\n\n### Max Planck Institute for the History of Science\n\nLastly, Malte briefly talked about one of their setups at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science. They have a small and limited setup of Python/Django applications that uses uWSGI. Due to the size and scope of the applications and thanks to uWSGI, they do manual deploys by pulling specific branches that are easy to handle. uWSGI is run in emperor mode as a service, such that rebooting the server is no problem, cf. Tutorial [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-django-applications-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04).\n\nRobert from the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science mentioned that they also used GitLab and GitLab CI for some applications.\n\n### Digital Innovation Group\n\nJulia from the Digital Innovation Group at Arizona State University briefly stated that their workflows include GitHub and Jenkins, and for Python apps Docker containers.\n\n### King's Digital Lab\n\nThe King's Digital Lab, for historical reasons, hosts a variety of projects based around different technologies: Java web projects, TEI projects, and Python/Django projects. For quite a while now they have been standardising their technology stack and most of the recent and new projects are built with Python/Django, Foundation for UI, and Vue.js for certain frontend functionality.\n\nThey have their own VMWare based infrastructure for hosting the projects, but that may change in the future. Each project has at most 3 instances, dev, staging and live. They use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for local development.\n\nKing’s Digital Lab mostly uses [GitHub](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/) for source control, but they also have some projects in [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/kingsdigitallab/), when they need more control over the CI pipeline or for private repositories. For continuous integration they use both Travis and Gitlab CI. The projects are deployed manually using a [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) script.\n\nThey make use of a startup configuration to start new projects to ensure they all follow the same guidelines that can be found [here](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/django-bare-bones).\n\nTo increase security and maintainability they are moving to a Docker based stack, and using [Cookiecutter Django fork](https://gitlab.com/kingsdigitallab/cookiecutter-django) for new projects, and some of the above will have to change, but for now this is still very much work in progress.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary it can be said that (not very surprisingly) there seem to be many different deployment/publishing setups that are specific to the individual infrastructures. While some run their services exclusively in the cloud, others customized their workflows to the available organizational infrastructures and requirements. It might also be worth noting that in many cases, developers are also responsible for the deployment processes, which might have an influence on how these deployment processes are designed.\n"})
lunr_index.add({ url: '/blog/2020-08-14-damerow-emails/', title: "Just sending email notifications", body: "I work as a scientific software engineer at Arizona State University (ASU). I head the [Digital Innovation Group](http://diging.asu.edu/) (or short DigInG) that develops software for historians and philosophers of science. I started this group when I was a graduate student together with another PhD student and besides a pause of about a year when I was working outside of academia after I graduated, DigInG has been a big part of my work life. Besides me, the group consists of one other software engineer and between ten to fifteen student workers. Our student workers help with software development and research related tasks such as data collection, annotation, etc.\n\nThe software applications we develop are mostly Java and Spring-based. We have some Python/Django apps, but we try to keep their number to a minimum. In my experience, they always give us more trouble than the Java apps (I’m happy to rant about them to anyone who wants to listen to my frustrations ;). Our code is hosted on GitHub and we more or less follow the Gitflow workflow in our projects. We organize the work that needs to be done via Jira tickets, and our student workers pick up tickets, create new branches for them, and make pull requests when they are done. The usual.\n\nA while back, I’ve decided to put all user management related functionality from one of our projects into their own jar so we can easily reuse it, since pretty much all our apps need a user management. I called it simple-users, put it into GitHub and Maven Central, and that was it. We made some changes to it over time, since it started out pretty basic, but it kept working well in our projects. Recently, one of our student workers worked on including simple-users into one of our new apps. He made the necessary configurations, added the necessary templates and controllers, and opened a pull request. When reviewing pull requests, I first look at the code changes before I tell our Jenkins instance to deploy the changes to our development server. Once deployed, I test the code in the application. The code changes seemed fine, so I changed the Jenkins configuration for the deployment job to include email provider information, which is needed for email notifications, and let Jenkins deploy the application.\n\nTo briefly interrupt my exciting story, that’s a feature that I love about Jenkins! I can tell it to run certain jobs simply by making a comment on the pull request. For example, Jenkins won’t run any jobs until I tell it so by making a comment. The default comment is “test this please,” which has confused student workers at times as they thought I was telling them to test their code. Especially, when code changes lead to database changes, I often don’t want to deploy an application right away but only after I reviewed the changes. One of our projects has some integration tests that I usually only want to run right before it’s ready to be merged, since they take a little longer to finish. In that case I can use a different comment that will only trigger the integration test job.\n\nAnyways, back to the story. The deployment went fine and I went to the application to test the changes. I created a new user and then started the reset password process of that user. I was waiting for an email. Nothing. I went back to the pull request, and looked at the code again. This time I saw that there were some annotations missing that were necessary to read the email provider properties into the Spring configuration bean. I made a comment on the pull request and closed it.\n\nAfter a little while the pull request was reopened with the required changes. Jenkins deployed the application, I tested it, and this time I got an exception that the connection was reset. I double-checked that the email provider configuration was right and checked with my student worker that it worked locally for them. It did when using [fakeSMTP](http://nilhcem.com/FakeSMTP/). I logged on to our development server and checked the logs to see if there was anything else that would give a hint what went wrong. Nothing.\n\nSo, I pulled the pull request to my laptop and ran it locally to be able to debug it. Using the configuration for the email service we use to send emails, I could reproduce the exception. Progress, even if just half a centimeter. I debugged it but still couldn’t find out why it wasn’t working. Everything seemed correct. I tried the same configuration that we use for one of our other apps for which emails have been sent fine in the past, and I got the same exception. I tried sending emails through the email service using their API and that worked; the issue was not on their end.\n\nFinally, I had the glorious idea to update the version of javax.mail. We were using 1.4.7 but the latest version is 1.6.2. And who would have thought, emails were sent just fine. Bottom line, I don’t know what the actual root cause for the issue was, but it seems like the email service provider changed something recently, which made the older version of javax.mail fail to create a connection. Since our apps are used by a limited number of people that typically don’t reset their passwords very often, we probably just haven’t run into that issue with any of our other applications yet.\n\nI pushed the updated version of simple-users to GitHub and started the Jenkins job to release it in Maven Central. Of course, this failed, why wouldn’t it. Apparently Sonatype had some issues that day, which made the maven goal that would publish simple-users fail. I ended up with a staged release in Maven Central, and a half updated pom.xml. So, I released simple-users by hand, fixed the pom.xml, and finally made a comment for my student worker on the pull request to update the version of simple-users.\n\nI looked at my watch. Hey, it was only noon! Time for our daily standup. I work remotely from the East Coast, which means I am two or three hours ahead of Arizona (depending on the time of year since Arizona does not have daylight savings time). It was only 9am in Arizona. My afternoon would probably bring more code reviews, some writing for papers I was working on, and maybe I would be able to get some coding done. Whatever it would be, I was just hoping it would be better than hunting down bugs just to find out that all that was needed was one tiny change in a pom file… It turned out it would be worse, but that is a story for another day.\n"})
lunr_index.add({ url: '/blog/2020-08-14-vogl-django/', title: "Simply updating the Django version ...", body: "Doing the sensible thing, as a first step I updated to the latest Django version, which was 3.1 at that time. Trying the debugging server of Django just gave me lots of errors. After a short search I realized, that of course also Django CMS needs to be updated, which was done in a breeze. Retrying the server, lots of new interesting errors.\n\nSince they looked like Python errors, I just froze the requirements from the Python virtual environment, and deleted the old environment. Since the server also needed some updates, I ran those as well, which gave me the latest Ubuntu LTS (18.04., since 20.04.1 was not yet released).\n\nHowever, the system need a reboot... After a short consideration with colleagues I dared to do the reboot! But.. no SSH shell access was coming back. Did the server needed a passphrase on reboot? Or did someone remove the cable in the server rack? Or did I accidentally crash the whole system :-/\n\nThere was only one option! Physically moving my self to the server in question. But! There was a key I needed to access the rack! In a room, to which only three persons had access, who all where in holiday on that day. And only one of the three had a key to the safe, in which the server rack key was securely deposited! Which was forgotten the following day. Which was a Friday! Arghhhhh!\n\nThe following Monday was my lucky day. Not only did I was able to enter the room with the safe, I also got the key to the server. And there were people answering my phone call, who let me in the data center. I even found a terminal and was able to connect it to the server!\n\nOk, the strange keyboard layout let to some problems with the root password, and I did not find any problems with the network settings, and there where no error messages at all, that gave any clue why the server was not reachable from the outer world, ... but in the end, after only a short hour of interesting detective work on the OS level, I just tried a reboot. And it worked. Sh..\n\nHaving thus not solved one problem, I tried the next. What went wrong with the Django update? After first trying to compile the latest Python version on Ubuntu 18, which lead to another interesting problem with uwsgi (the system Python version and the version in the v-env need to be exactly the same!), I realized my simple error: The latest Django CMS version was not yet supporting the latest Django version (django-cms 3.7.4 vs django 3.1 was the problem, only django 3.0.9 is supported !). One more time removing the virtual environment and this time installing the correct version numbers, I restarted the systemd daemon for uwsgi, and voila! as good as new.\n\nMy lesson learned: Never touch a run.. well, you know the story...\n"})

lunr_index.add({ url: '/dhrse-whitepaper', title: "The DH RSE Workshop White Paper by DHTech", body: "<p>\nAt the DH 2019 conference, a group of people that identify themselves broadly as Digital Humanities Research Software Engineers came together for a <a href=\"/dh-workshop-2019\">workshop</a>. This white paper is the outcome of this workshop. It aims to draw attention to some of the issues we observe and experience and invite anyone who is interested to join us.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Who are we?</h3>\n<p>\nAn important and large part of the broad and diverse Digital Humanities (DH) community can be defined as the ones who conceptualize, develop, and maintain algorithms, develop tools and websites, model data, and implement and maintain research software in order to solve Humanities research questions. This group, the Digital Humanities Research Software Engineers (DH RSEs), is crucial for the success of any DH project. There is a wide range of DH RSEs from programmers with a strong humanities background who acquired programming skills later in their careers, to software developers who acquired their DH knowledge over time through working with humanities scholars. However, what is lacking is the awareness of the importance of DH RSEs, a clear career path, and academic recognition, for example due to inadequate publication systems for software and data. We argue that without DH RSEs there would be no DH as almost no DH project can be realized without someone who understands the approaches and methods of the research domain and is able to conceptualize and implement the digital or computational part of a humanities research project.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Communication</h3>\n<p>\nAn important skill of DH RSEs is the ability to mediate between the technological world and humanities scholars. This requires an understanding of the approaches and thought processes used by both the humanities discipline and the computational technique. One of the keys to successful communication is understanding the assumptions of the discipline, those things that are so obvious to researchers in the field that they would not explicitly state them unless asked about them directly. RSEs who are experienced in humanities disciplines either understand the assumptions of the field already or know enough to be able to predict what they might be and ask about them. A continuous dialogue between RSEs and humanities scholars is needed to make this ad-hoc knowledge transferable and available for RSEs new to the field.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Career Paths</h3>\n<p>\nDH RSEs have various different roles in an academic context. Some work on software development, data analysis, or are designing representations of results; others manage software development projects and infrastructure in a wider context. DH RSEs are sometimes directly embedded into a specific research field, or work in more service oriented facilities.  \n</p>\n<p>\nWhile there are some institutions offering career paths for more “service-oriented” DH RSEs, this is not the standard yet. Additionally, there is no clear career path for “embedded” DH RSEs and their role as part of the research community is not always clear. Many DH RSEs start out as PhD students and might move on to postdoctoral positions. Since a big part of their work focuses on software development, however, this turns out to be a dead-end career as the development of software tools is not recognized as valuable contribution in terms of career progression (publications are in most places still required to move on to an assistant professorship). In addition, the “traditional” career path (PhD, Postdoc, professorship) is not the desired career path for many DH RSEs, but alternatives are lacking. Since DH RSEs are such an essential part of DH research, we argue that a clear career path is strongly needed to keep experienced and attract new DH RSEs.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\n<p>\nRecognition is a problem for many people working in RSE roles. There is no formally agreed way to credit work done towards research outputs other than the traditional author/co-author roles. In many fields, including DH this model is not reflective of how research is conducted. There are many varied roles taken in DH projects, in a very small scale project these may be filled by one or two co-authors but in larger projects there will be many people involved in data creation, data management, software development, statistics and visualisation and probably many others on top of the standard role of interpreting the research in a written form for publication.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe kind of recognition required in DH strongly depends on the chosen career path. Postdocs in RSE roles and embedded RSEs might have different needs from persons working in RSE service units. These different backgrounds and futures need to be taken into account by institutions and funding agencies. For DH RSEs pursuing a more traditional academic career, the development of software tools, creation and cleaning of datasets should be taken into account when applying for positions. Similarly, it should be common practice to cite and refer to the software and their creators in publications if the software played a crucial part in the research process. If a project would not have been possible without the help of an RSE, this RSE should be named and potentially even be co-author on publications. Some journals, for example, “PLOS One” (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/), explicitly state the contributions of each author allowing RSEs to be acknowledged for their work. While this practice is not universal, there are efforts underway to increase the visibility of this issue and to standardize non-traditional publication roles  (see, for example, Holcombe 2019 for a discussion of this issue).\n</p>\n\n<h3>\nFunding\n</h3>\n\n<p>\nMany (if not most) DH projects depend on the work of RSEs to accomplish their goals. Often, grant proposals promise a piece of software, an interactive website or the development of a new algorithm as one of the project deliverables. However, it is not the norm yet that RSEs are involved in the planning and writing phases of the grant application process. This leads to inadequate time and funding allocated for the technical aspects of the project. It is also important that funding agencies have appropriate processes for reviewing the technical aspects of a project and ask the right questions of applicants to ensure that these technical questions are addressed from the inception of the project. RSEs are the people who can work with applicants to answer these questions and should be involved in this from the very beginning of a project.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Community</h3>\n\n<p>\nDH RSEs are not only part of the DH community but also of the wider research software engineering community (RSE 2019). All RSEs face common issues, but DH RSEs are currently not very well represented or vocal within either community. We have already made a start on establishing a group within the Digital Humanities, called DHTech, as a place where ideas can be discussed and where we can learn from each other and our experiences. By coming together and working as a group, we hope to increase the visibility and amplify the voice of DH RSEs in both communities. DHTech offers regular webinars, has a mailing list and a Slack channel. It can be joined <a href=\"/join\">here</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Authors</h3>\n<p>\nRobert Casties, Alexander Czmiel, Julia Damerow, Max Ionov, Albert Meroño Peñuela, Steve Ranford, Catherine Smith, Malte Vogl\n</p>\n\n<style>\n.bib {\n   margin: 0 0 5px 0;\n   padding-left: 30px;\n   text-indent: -30px;\n   text-align: left;\n}\n</style>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p class=\"bib\">\n<b>AG Research Software Engineering in den Digital Humanities (im DHd-Verband)</b>. <i>Home</i> (2019).
